# CSCI_6527-Final-Project

Recognizing and addressing distractions by drivers in real time can play a vital role in preventing accidents and saving lives. The goal of this project is to develop a system capable of accurately identifying various driver activities through computer vision techniques. The primary objective is to design and implement a deep learning model that can classify different activities performed by drivers inside vehicles. Additionally, the system aims to annotate and detect objects like bottles, cups/cans, cell phones, etc., within the vehicle cabin using YOLO model. This helps provide additional context to driver activities and enhances distraction detection.
